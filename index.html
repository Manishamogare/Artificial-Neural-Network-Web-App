                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modeling yarn properties from fiber parameters has been a theme
                    of research for many years. Mechanistic and statistical approaches have been
                    dominating the area. The limitations and strengths of both approaches have
                    been appreciated and presently neural networks, fuzzy logic, and computer
                    simulations are being explored. The use of artificial neural networks for
                    predicting yarn properties from fiber parameters is discussed in this chapter

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The industrial relevance of the topic of yarn property modeling is obvious. 
                    Predicting product performance and its properties from raw material 
                    characteristics has been a theme of research in many areas including textiles. 
                    The outcome of a process in the textile industry could be a fiber, yarn, fabric 
                    or garment.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Manufacturing each product is an industry by itself. The yarn 
                    manufacturing industry involves a large number of processes such as opening, 
                    cleaning, carding, drawing, combing, roving preparation and spinning that 
                    lead to the production of yarns of various counts and blends. Knowing what is 
                    expected from a raw material is important to both the supplier of raw material 
                    and the purchaser.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A cotton grower would like to know what 
                    sort of yarn quality can be produced from his crop so that he can claim the 
                    right price for his produce. The buyer, a spinning mill, would be interested 
                    in knowing whether it is possible to attain the desired yarn properties from 
                    a particular variety of cotton it intends to buy. The user of the yarn, either 
                    a knitter or a weaver, will be interested in knowing the performance of the 
                    yarn from its physical and mechanical properties.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, there is a need for 
                    a reliable method for predicting yarn properties from fiber characteristics 
                    and relevant yarn parameters.

                    complex and interactive. Hence there is a need to follow a non-traditional 
                    approach to model them.

                <p>The problem of trying to predict yarn properties from fiber properties & process parameters can be
                    viewed
                    as one of function.<br><br>
                    yarn property = f (fiber properties, fiber configuration and their arrangement, yarn count, yarn
                    twist).<br><br>
                    Fiber configuration and their arrangement in a way is a reflection of the dynamics of the process.
                    If
                    the process remains constant then it may be considered to be a black box and the yarn property then
                    becomes a function of fiber properties and yarn count.<br><br>
                    So that, ANN can predict yarn properties approximately.

                    5. Set up network topology assuming it to be a three-layer network. Select
